👍 Positive Signs

✅ High Episode Reward (ep_rew_mean = 955)

    Your agent is achieving relatively high rewards on average.
    This suggests it is learning some useful scheduling strategies.

✅ Training Speed (fps = 249)

    The model is running efficiently.

⚠ Areas for Improvement

🔸 approx_kl = 0.446 (Too High!)

    The KL divergence measures how much the new policy diverges from the old one.
    High KL means the policy is changing too aggressively, which can cause instability.
    Fix: Reduce learning_rate or increase clip_range slightly.

🔸 clip_fraction = 0.797 (Too High!)

    Nearly 80% of updates are being clipped, meaning the optimizer is rejecting many updates.
    Fix: Lower the learning_rate to prevent extreme policy updates.

🔸 explained_variance = -0.872 (Very Poor!)

    This measures how well the value function explains variance in returns.
    Negative values mean the value function is basically random.
    Fix:
        Check if the reward function is well-shaped.
        Normalize rewards if needed.
        Increase the model complexity (more training steps).

🔸 Entropy Loss (entropy_loss = -16.9)

    Entropy loss controls exploration. Lower values mean less exploration.
    Fix: Try increasing entropy_coef to encourage exploration.

🔧 Suggested Fixes

1️⃣ Reduce learning rate (learning_rate = 0.0005 or 0.0003)
2️⃣ Increase clip_range slightly (clip_range = 0.25)
3️⃣ Normalize rewards (reward = reward / max_possible_reward)
4️⃣ Train longer and monitor explained variance

Your model is on the right track—just needs some fine-tuning! 🚀
